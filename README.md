# END TO END ML MODEL: Auto Evaluator: Car Price Predictor
Project Description 🚗💰
Welcome to the Auto Evaluator - Car Price Predictor project! This project aims to predict the prices of used cars using machine learning techniques. 
you're a buyer looking for a good deal or a seller trying to set a fair price, this tool will provide valuable insights into the estimated price of a car based on various factors.

Requirements 📋
Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
Flask (for web application deployment)

Data Cleaning and Outlier Detection 🧹📊

Data Cleaning: We handle missing values and inconsistent data types in the dataset, ensuring the reliability of our predictive models.
Outlier Detection: We identify and handle outliers in the dataset to improve the performance of machine learning models.

Model Building 🛠️🔢
We build machine learning models for predicting car prices, including:

Linear Regression: Basic regression model
Ridge Regression: Regression model with L2 regularization
Lasso Regression: Regression model with L1 regularization

Model Evaluation and Results 📊
We evaluate the performance of each model using metrics like R-squared score:
Linear Regression: R-squared score of 0.85
Ridge Regression: R-squared score of 0.79
Lasso Regression: R-squared score of 0.07 (with a convergence warning)
Model Deployment 🚀🌐
We create a Flask web application for the Car Price Predictor, providing a user-friendly interface for predicting car prices.

Web Application: Flask is used for web application deployment.
Prediction Interface: Users can input car details and get predicted prices.
Conclusion 🎉🔍
The Auto Evaluator - Car Price Predictor project provides an end-to-end solution for predicting car prices in the used car market. 
By leveraging machine learning techniques and deploying a user-friendly web application, it facilitates informed decision-making for both buyers and sellers.
The project demonstrates the effectiveness of regression models in estimating car prices based on relevant features, contributing to a more transparent and efficient used car trading process.
