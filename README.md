Models Used 🤖
Linear Regression 📈

Basic regression model used for predicting car prices based on input features.
Ridge Regression 🛤️

Regression model with L2 regularization to handle multicollinearity in the dataset.
Lasso Regression 🏗️

Regression model with L1 regularization for feature selection and sparsity in coefficients.
Model Evaluation 📊
R-squared Score: 📈
Metric used to evaluate the performance of regression models.
Measures the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is predictable from the input features.
Higher R-squared scores indicate better model fit to the data.
Requirements 📋
Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
Flask (for web application deployment)
Conclusion 🎉
The Auto Evaluator - Car Price Predictor project provides an end-to-end solution for predicting car prices in the used car market. By leveraging machine learning techniques and deploying a user-friendly web application, it facilitates informed decision-making for both buyers and sellers. The project demonstrates the effectiveness of regression models in estimating car prices based on relevant features, contributing to a more transparent and efficient used car trading process.
